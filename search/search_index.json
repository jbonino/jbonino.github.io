Movement 1.2. The environmental impact 1.3. Interacts\\Using stuff 2. Core Mechanics\\Standarts 2.1. Guns 2.2. Game modes The game for now will have 2 game modes: - Infection In Infection mode, maps are designed to make survival/escape gameplay, where humans should do tasks to escape zombies, and zombies should prevent humans from doing those. Maps are bigger than in Deathmatch, have more space to dodge, and have unique tasks/lore. Max players per server is 16, from this amount, 4 of them should be starting zombies (the amount changes by the total number of players on the server). Zombies win if they infect all humans, or by time end, and humans gain victory if they complete the main map task or escape. Deathmatch In Deathmatch mode, maps are smaller than in Infection to prevent hide & seek and increase the chance of meeting an enemy player. In this game mode, you will be again separated into 2 teams, but this time amount of players in them should be equal or almost equal (the difference can be in 1 player). Here one team should eliminate another team, players will now have more possibilities to use their character abilities and be more free in tactical vision. Zombies & humans cannot be revived in this game mode, if you die once - you won't revive. But timer also plays its role, if time is up - zombies win, so humans should eliminate zombies in time to win. Teams will contain 5 players each 2.3. Different characters Characters are in-game playable \"classes\", with their unique abilities, looks, and phrases. You can collect those in your loadout inventory for both teams and then play as them in matches. The most common way to obtain them is to buy them in the shop for different currencies, such as Credits and Octaxes; But in rare cases, you can receive them for free from sales or obtain them from events that give you special characters marked as \"Event\". In the game, there are 4 character rarities: Common, Rare, Epic & Event. 2.4. Abilities 2.5. Level system 2.6. Humans Abel Class rarity: Epic (from 09.01.24) Abilities: -By default, he deals more damage to targets far from him. The further the target, the more damage he deals. 1 (E) - \"Steel bullets\" Next bullet with 100% chance will stun an enemy for 4 seconds, other bullets will deal 5% more damage until ability time ends (lasts 5 seconds?)

(mark lasts 15secs) (Recharge 40secs) 2 (Q) - \"Double clip\" After activating he obtains double ammo amount in clip until it is empty (meaning, if gun had 30 ammo per clip, he will have 60 after activating) (2 times per match) Description: Phrases: Owen Class rarity: Common (from 09.01.24) Abilities: 1 (E) - \"Energizer\" Drinks a can of energizer that gives +30% speed boost for 10 secs (recharge 1min) 2 (Q) - Description: Phrases: 2.7.

Debuff reduces player speed by 5%, rate of fire by 15%, and increases ability cooldown by 10% (effect lasts 20sec) Description: Phrases: Rotten Class rarity: Rare (from 09.01.24) Abilities: 1 (E) - \"Decaying trap\" Spits a decaying substance in front of him that stays for 20 seconds on the ground as a puddle, and it damages Human players if they step on it 2 (Q) - \"Shield\" Creates blisters on his body, which adds 10% to damage reduction, stays for 10 secs Description: Phrases: Civil Class rarity: Common (from 09.01.24) Abilities: 1 (E) - \" 2 (Q) - Description: Phrases: 3.

Match results calculations If it's an Infection mode, then the calculations are: 1) For each kill - 50 Credits 2) For Human time survival - (If the player survived less than 30 seconds, he would not receive a reward for time survival!) Each survived second adds 0,01 to the total multiplier amount, then the total multiplier is multiplied by 20, and you receive the total money for your survival. Example: The player survived 2:46 minutes, which means he survived 166 seconds, then we multiply seconds by 0,01 number and receive 1,66, and finally we multiply 1,66 by 20 and we have = 33 Credits (Tenths are rounded) 3) For your team's victory - 40 Credits (If you were infected during the match, it means you are in the zombie's team right? And if every human were killed, does it mean they all receive rewards? NO. If you were infected during the match, you will be counted as a zombie team player only IF you were infected in the first 1/3 of the round, otherwise you are in Human team) 4) If you claimed: - 1st place - 20 credits - 2nd - 14 credits - 3rd - 8 credits 5) If it's a Deathmatch mode, then the calculations are: 5.4.

There they can buy sales, characters and equipment for each team. Then customize this all in loadout, by equipping weapons and characters to their will.
