You can play as a Humans and Zombies, but which team you will play, depends on many factors, such as: - Game mode - Being infected by zombie (works in Infection mode) - The game chooses you to spawn as Human\\Zombie (works in Infection mode) - You've been separated by game in 2 teams (works in Deathmatch mode) Players have access to customize both teams in the menu. There they can buy sales, characters and equipment for each team. Then customize this all in loadout, by equipping weapons and characters to their will. Each of these can affect the gameplay and give advantages/disadvantages to players, such as different characters, which have their unique look and abilities; weapons, which can help in fights and other stuff. In most cases, each team's goal is to defeat another, again this depends on game mode, about this we will tell you sooner. Zombies win when human team is eliminated or loses by time, and humans win when zombies are eliminated or humans escape (special in Infection mode). Cooperate with your team to achieve victory, in solo, you're less likely to win.
